# WillTheAvsWin
A Side project that pulls in data about the Avalanche and then predicts if they will win their next game! 

I am not affiliated in any official capacity with the Avalanche or the NHL. This is purely a project for fun.

=============Setting up VirtualEnv====================  

This project will require many packages that are not installed on the system you're using. To setup a virtual enviorment for the application do the following in a unix based or ubuntu system(terminal if using the windows subsytem)  

Use the following commands:  
sudo apt install python3-pip  
pip install virtualenv  
  
Outside of the WillTheAvsWin directory, make another folder. If not be sure to add a .gitignore!  
Run the following commands:  
virtualenv <virtualenv name>  
source <virtualenv name>/bin/activate  
  
  
Navigate to the WillTheAvsWin directory then run:  
pip -r requirements.txt
  
After this you should have all libraries required to run the project to its current moment!
